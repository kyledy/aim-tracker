# aim-tracker
A simple aim tracker in Pygame. One of the first projects I ever made when I started getting interested in game design. It is a very simple version of "AimLabs", a popular game used by First-Person Shooter (FPS) players which help players get better at aiming at precise locations. 

I wanted to do this because I thought it would be a fun challenge to try and recreate in Python.
